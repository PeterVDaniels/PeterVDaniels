;; --- Changelog for Commit on May 29, 2025 ---
;; - Fixed duplicate keys in flip-hole function, removing 252 style warnings.
;; - Enhanced Techno Pulse sensitivity in if++ function to better react to input symbols.
;; - Added subculture-relevant paths in compute-transformation-info for neural-diagram.
;; - Introduced "Madness Factor" in neural-diagram node labels to reflect chaotic energy.
;; - Improved coherence scoring in pete-treaty and adjusted treaty principles for better balance.
;; - Added random Urban Youth phrase injection in thought trails and final output for more flair.
;; - Ensured Techno Pulse always picks at least one input symbol for consistency.
